# GuardEngine

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

GuardEngine is a **deterministic rule, contract, and evidence evaluation library** for six independent specialist Guards.
It does **not** parse Java/Rust source, call an LLM, authorize a Git merge, or claim that an architecture is optimal.

## Local integration implementation (review branch)

This branch adds the separate `guard.integration/v1alpha1` envelope, bound-attempt lifecycle, bounded verification and producer evaluation, borrowed `FactBudget`, pure eligibility/attempt-store ports, and private Unix per-attempt publication. Native commands and the legacy wire remain unchanged. Authority ports are not a real identity provider; in-memory CAS is not durable storage. The frozen six-consumer local protocol matrix is verified; production qualification, hosted enforcement and public release remain pending.

See [implementation evidence](docs/implementation-progress.md), [YAML integration limits](docs/yaml-integration-profile.md), [fact construction budget](docs/fact-construction-budget.md), [trust API](docs/integration-trust-api.md), and [verified independent local artifact](docs/local-artifact-release-adr.md). The source-baseline sections below describe the original main inspection; this local implementation supersedes their integration-feature availability statements.

## v0.1.0 / Guard Protocol v1alpha1

- **Contract Engine:** load/validate strict versioned YAML contracts.
- **Rule Engine:** evaluate exact relationship assertions over analyzer-produced facts.
- **Evidence Engine:** produce deterministic JSON reports with input digests and a reproducible evaluation ID.
- **Analyzer interface:** `GuardAnalyzer` trait, implemented by specialized Guards.
- **Fail closed:** partial analyzer facts yield `INDETERMINATE` and `BLOCK`.
- **Unsigned by design:** local reports have `signed: false`; verification means recomputation, **not** trusted provenance.

## Quick start

Place the sibling [ArchGuard](https://github.com/full-stack-plugins/archguard) checkout beside GuardEngine:

```text
workspace-full-stack-plugins/
├── guardengine/
└── archguard/
```

From `archguard` (PowerShell or Bash):

```sh
cargo run -- check --project fixtures/forbidden --contract examples/agent-job-contract.yaml --facts facts.json --report evidence.json
# Expected exit code: 2 (BLOCK); both files are produced before the exit.

cd ../guardengine
cargo run -- verify --contract ../archguard/examples/agent-job-contract.yaml --facts ../archguard/facts.json --report ../archguard/evidence.json
# Expected exit code: 2: evidence is consistent but the rule BLOCKS.
```

Alternatively generate facts from a `GuardAnalyzer` implementation and, after building/installing the binary on PATH, call:

```sh
guardengine evaluate --contract contract.yaml --facts facts.json --report report.json
guardengine verify --contract contract.yaml --facts facts.json --report report.json
```

Exit codes: `0=ALLOW`, `2=BLOCK`, `3=REQUIRE_APPROVAL`, `4=invalid input/runtime/verification failure`.

## Guard Protocol

| Component | v1alpha1 format |
|---|---|
| Contract | YAML `apiVersion: guard.partme.ai/v1alpha1`, `kind: GuardContract` |
| Facts | JSON `kind: GuardFacts`, sourced by a specialized Guard |
| Report | JSON `kind: GuardReport`, deterministic evaluations |
| Rule | Exact `forbid_relation(subject, predicate, object)` |
| Enforcement | `enforce`, `review`, `advise` |
| Rule status | `PASS`, `FAIL`, `REVIEW_REQUIRED`, `INDETERMINATE`, reserved `NOT_APPLICABLE` |
| Decision | `ALLOW`, `BLOCK`, `REQUIRE_APPROVAL` |

Unknown protocol fields, versions, and rule variants are rejected, never ignored. `advise` emits matched facts with a nonblocking advisory detail: `PASS` means the rule did not block, **not** that there was no observation.

See [architecture](docs/architecture.md), [technical design](docs/technical-design.md), [shared integration draft](docs/integration-contract.md), [protocol contract](docs/protocol.md), [trust boundaries](docs/security.md), and [OpenSpec plan](openspec/changes/bootstrap-guard-protocol/).

### Scope and limitations

1. Only one rule operator is available; there is no arbitrary Rego/JS/Python expression execution.
2. Fact completeness is **claimed by the analyzer**. A malicious local agent can fabricate inputs. Trusted CI must independently regenerate facts using protected contract versions.
3. ArchGuard's current snapshot digest covers examined **Cargo manifests**, not the entire Git tree.
4. Reports are unsigned and not attestations. Signing, approvals, policy exception registries, Git branch control, and semantic code graphs are future integrations.
5. ArchGuard currently declares a local sibling path dependency on GuardEngine. Independent consumption awaits replacement with a pinned, released GuardEngine artifact.

## Implementation and target design

Reviewed source baseline: main `0284f1ef4bb93e6602d5a65a5341f10e01a63ddf` (2026-10-09). The crate and CLI exist at v0.1.0, using Rust edition 2024 with minimum Rust 1.85. Source evidence: `src/protocol.rs`, `src/engine.rs`, `src/analyzer.rs`, `src/main.rs`; 10 test functions exist under `tests/`. This documentation review did not execute them.

At that historical main inspection, ArchGuard was the embedded consumer and four Guards had only design documents. The current local branches contain six independent producers/adapters; CodeGuard retains its mature implementation. See the [frozen local matrix](docs/local-consumer-matrix.md) for exact producer pins and supported capabilities.

The opt-in integration library now validates versioned run envelopes, exact bindings and generic eligibility using injected authenticated-record ports, including expiration/revocation and append/CAS histories. Real identity providers and production controllers remain outside this implementation. `load_envelope_json` accepts the separate `guard.integration/v1alpha1` format; native contract/facts/report loaders do not. The historical `guard.partme.ai/v1alpha1` wire namespace is retained for compatibility; it is not a project-name prefix.

## Library and CI integration

Library callers use `load_contract_yaml`, `load_facts_json`, `evaluate` and `verify_report`, with typed errors. Specialist analyzers implement `GuardAnalyzer`; domain parsing and policy meaning stay outside the engine.

`evaluate` emits JSON to stdout only when `--report` is omitted; with that flag it writes the file. `verify` writes a consistency message to stderr, returns the report's decision code, and emits no JSON success envelope. Errors are currently plain stderr. A consistent BLOCK report therefore exits 2, not 0. Use fresh per-attempt output paths and inspect exit status; file existence alone is insufficient.

Trusted CI must obtain protected policy, independently analyze the exact candidate, verify scope and bind artifacts to that candidate. Current engine reports do not enforce branch protection, authenticate approvals or invalidate stale runs automatically. CodeGuard's existing exit codes differ and require a command-aware adapter.

## Validation status

Source, documentation links and command declarations were inspected. At the earlier architecture-review stage Cargo and OpenSpec were unavailable on PATH, so that stage claimed no functional or OpenSpec validation pass. The later planning-stage validation is recorded separately below. See the technical design for the source ledger, current limitations and measurable future acceptance gates.

## OpenSpec implementation backlog

The incremental [proposal](openspec/changes/add-versioned-guard-integration-contracts/proposal.md), [design](openspec/changes/add-versioned-guard-integration-contracts/design.md), [requirements](openspec/changes/add-versioned-guard-integration-contracts/specs/) and [tasks](openspec/changes/add-versioned-guard-integration-contracts/tasks.md) translate the architecture into pending implementation work. See the [cross-repository dependency roadmap](openspec/guard-roadmap.md) and [structural validation record](openspec/validation-2026-10-09.md). The task checklist records independently reviewed local implementation (17/24 at this checkpoint); remaining tasks stay unchecked. The current suite has61 tests, with exact validation and limitations recorded in [implementation progress](docs/implementation-progress.md). Earlier source-tree inventories and validation limitations describe the inspected baseline or earlier architecture-review stage; this planning stage adds OpenSpec artifacts and separately records actual CLI validation. Existing change ownership and historical completion evidence remain intact.
